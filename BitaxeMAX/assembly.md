# SMD Soldering Guide with Convection Toaster Oven

To achieve successful SMD soldering, follow these steps using a convection toaster oven and the recommended tools.

## Tools and Equipment:

1. **Convection Toaster Oven:**

   - [BLACK+DECKER TO3250XSB 8-Slice Extra Wide Convection Countertop Toaster Oven](https://www.amazon.com/BLACK-DECKER-TO3250XSB-Convection-Countertop/dp/B00LU2I428)
     - Ensure it has a fan inside for more even heating.
     - Never use this oven for food.

2. **Thermocouple Thermometer:**

   - [Digital Thermocouple Temperature Thermometer, PEAKMETER PM6501](https://www.amazon.com/Thermocouple-Temperature-Thermometer-PEAKMETER-Fahrenheit/dp/B08L11MMFM)
     - Make sure the probe and probe jacket can go up to ~300°C.

3. **Solder Paste:**

   - [Chip Quik SMD291AX50T3 Solder Paste in jar 50g (T3) Sn63/Pb37 no clean](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BH5LP5G)
     - Keep it in the refrigerator for optimal stenciling results.
     - Wash hands well after handling.

4. **Tweezers:**

   - [Aven 18072ARS 7-SA Style Artis Tweezer](https://www.amazon.com/Aven-18072ARS-Style-Tweezer-Yellow/dp/B01D4R1OXW)
     - Curved Aven Technik 7-SA Tweezers for placing parts.

5. **Magnifier Headset:**
   - [Headband Magnifier Hands-Free Jeweler Loupe Head Mount Magnifying Headset Visor](https://www.amazon.com/Headband-Magnifier-Jeweler-Magnifying-Replaceable/dp/B08RYVH7DL)
     - Dorky but effective, especially for small components.

## Soldering Process:

1. **Stencil and Paste:**

   - Use Sn63/Pb37 solder paste.
   - Keep paste in the refrigerator before stenciling.
   - Take your time to stencil correctly. Wipe off excess paste with IPA if needed.

2. **Component Placement:**

   - Use tweezers to place components on the pasted board.
   - Consider using a magnifier headset for precision.

3. **Reflow Process:**

   - Place the board(s) on the wire rack inside the toaster oven.
   - Insert the thermocouple inside, ensuring it holds above the PCB.
   - Turn on convection bake, medium setting.
   - Soak Phase (140-150°C for 2 minutes): Maintain even temperature.
   - Reflow Phase (200-220°C for 30 seconds): Watch for paste melting.
   - Turn off the toaster oven and open the door.

4. **Cooling and Inspection:**

   - Let the boards cool with the oven door open.
   - Once cool, inspect with a microscope for dry pads or bridges.
   - Repair using paste flux, solder braid, and a soldering iron if necessary.

5. **Double-Sided Boards:**
   - If parts are on both sides, repeat the process for the second side.
   - Use a metal stand to keep bottom-side parts off the wire rack.

Happy soldering!
